Software engineers are computer science professionals who use engineering principles and programming languages to build software and run network control systems. Software engineers play an important role in making sure computers and mobile devices operate correctly. They bring a considerable amount of knowledge to roles in the areas of programming languages, software development and computer operating systems. They must also understand engineering principles as they relate to the creation of software applications and systems.Software engineers are strategically minded individuals who tend to excel in left- and right-brained thinking (analytical as well as creative skills). They are usually instinctive problem solvers, able to use tools such as the principles of applied mathematics and computer science to design, develop and troubleshoot computer software. Ideally, software engineers should also be people that work well with others and are motivated to see a project through to the end.All software engineers have the shared mission of solving digital problems with quality (debugged) software. -DeVry University
